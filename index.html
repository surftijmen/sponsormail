Hi [Contact Person Name],

My name is Tijmen Meijer, and I’m reaching out on behalf of Sterre Meijer (known as @surfsterre on social media). Sterre is a 20-year-old Dutch skateboarder, model, and social media creator with an audience of over 4 million followers across Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat. She has built a vibrant community of young, engaged fans, and I believe a partnership with [Brand Name] could be a fantastic fit for both sides.
Sterre creates all her own content – from Instagram Reels and TikToks to YouTube vlogs and Snapchat stories – with exceptional creativity and a unique, authentic touch. Her posts routinely garner high engagement, and her youthful energy and style resonate strongly with Gen Z audiences. She’s often referred to as an “it-girl” of skateboarding and was recently featured in the Olympic Channel’s “Skate-Hers” series, which highlighted her as a rising star in the skateboarding world. In short, Sterre’s blend of skateboarding, fitness, and fashion content makes her a versatile influencer who can connect with audiences across sports, lifestyle, and style-focused niches.
Why partner with Sterre and [Brand Name]? Sterre is selective about brand partnerships and only works with brands she genuinely loves – she often says “if it comes naturally, it will work out best,” and her audience can feel that authenticity. We see a natural alignment between Sterre’s personal brand and [Brand Name]’s image. Her creativity and organic approach to showcasing products would make any collaboration with [Brand Name] feel genuine and compelling to her followers. Whether it’s featuring [Brand Name] in an upbeat skate video, an honest product review, or a stylish photoshoot, Sterre has a proven ability to spotlight products in a way that engages her audience and highlights the brand in a positive light.
Sterre is open to both gifted product collaborations and paid sponsorships (with a preference for a paid partnership when working with larger brands like [Brand Name]). We can tailor the collaboration to suit your goals – for example, a series of creative social media posts, a dedicated video, a brand ambassadorship, or any other format that aligns with your campaign. I’d be happy to provide more details such as Sterre’s media kit, audience demographics, or past campaign examples if you’re interested.
Thank you very much for taking the time to consider this outreach. [Brand Name] is a brand we admire, and we would love the opportunity to work together. If this sounds like a potential fit, I’d be excited to discuss ideas or answer any questions you may have. Feel free to let me know a convenient time for a call or if you’d like any additional information. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully exploring how Sterre can support [Brand Name]’s upcoming initiatives.
 
Kind regards,

Tijmen Meijer
