Dear [Contact Person Name],

My name is Tijmen Meijer, and I manage Sterre Meijer (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/surfsterre" target="_blank">@surfsterre</a> on social media). Sterre is a 20-year-old Dutch skateboarder, model, and social media creator with an audience of over 4 million followers across her socials. She has built a vibrant community of young, engaged fans, and I believe a partnership with [Brand Name] could be a fantastic fit for both sides.

Sterre creates all her own content – from Instagram Reels and TikToks to YouTube lifestyle videos and Snapchat spotlights – with exceptional creativity and a unique, authentic touch. Her posts always gain high engagement, and her youthful energy and style resonate strongly with Gen Z audiences. She’s often referred to as the “it-girl” of skateboarding and was recently featured in the Olympic Channel’s “Skate-Hers” series, which highlighted her as a rising star in the skateboarding world. In short, Sterre’s blend of skateboarding, fitness, and fashion content makes her a versatile influencer who can connect with audiences across sports, lifestyle, and style-focused niches.

She is open to both gifted product collaborations, paid sponsorships or as ambassador, depending on your interest.  I’d be happy to provide more details such as Sterre’s audience demographics or past campaign examples if you’re interested. In the attachement you can find her media-kit to get a better overview.

Thank you very much for taking the time to consider this outreach. [Brand Name] is a brand we admire, and we would love the opportunity to work together. If this sounds like a potential fit, I’d be excited to discuss ideas or answer any questions you may have. Feel free to let me know a convenient time for a call or if you’d like any additional information. I look forward to hearing from you and hopefully exploring how Sterre can support [Brand Name]’s upcoming initiatives.
 
Kind regards,

Tijmen Meijer
