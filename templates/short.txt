Dear [Contact Person Name],

My name is Tijmen Meijer, and I manage Sterre Meijer, a 20-year-old Dutch skateboarder, model, and social media creator (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/surfsterre" target="_blank">@surfsterre</a>) with an audience of over 4 million followers across her socials.

Sterre’s unique blend of skateboarding, fashion, and lifestyle content has positioned her as a standout voice for Gen Z audiences worldwide, where she is seen as the ‘it-girl’ of skateboarding. Whether she’s styling her latest streetwear looks or sharing her active lifestyle, her content feels authentic, trend-forward, and relatable. She’s built real trust with her audience, making her a perfect fit for lifestyle and fashion brands looking to connect with the next generation.

Sterre is open to both gifted collaborations and paid partnerships. You’ll find her media kit attached with more details about her audience and past campaigns. We’d love to explore ways she can bring [Brand Name] to life through engaging, original content across her platforms.

If you’re open to discussing this further, I’d be happy to set up a quick call or answer any questions you may have. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts.
 
Kind regards,

Tijmen Meijer
